Why we need Abstract class or Interface?
  - for code maintenability
  - to provide an atchitecture for all derived classes
  - its less error prone
  - to prevent creation of object we make a class abstract

Abstract class have constructor and why?
  - yes, used to initialize the fields.
  - when instatnce of derived class is created, parent abstract class constructor is automatically called first.
    there's an implicit call to the base constructor prior to the derived constructor execution.
  - constructor should be protected.
  
Interface and Abstract Diffrence :

  - Interface can have implementation for any of its member where as abstract class can have or cannot
  - Interface is public where as abstract can have any access modifier(default private)
  - Interface cannot have fields where as abstract classes can have
  - Interface can inherite from interface only where as abstract class can inherit from other abstract as well as interface
  - Interface cannot have constructor where as abstract can have
