- Static is a concept where we create one copy and share it accross all the instances of the class.
- Static : 
        class
        constructor
        fields
        property
        method
   
- Cannot be Static : 
        Structure
        interface
        destructor
        Abstract
- Abstract classes contain abstract methods that should be implemented in derived classes. 
  static keyword in class definition means that all methods in the class are static as well. 
  But static methods cannot be inherited or overridden, and that is why they can't be abstract.
 
 - Static class
   only contain static members.
   cannot be instantiated.
   are sealed.
   can have only one static constructor and that too parameterless
   static members are accessed using class name
   
 - Static field
   static field is shared among all the object of a class, So if an object changes this value, then all the object of this class will get changedvalue
