# C-OOPS
Class : its a design /buleprint or architecture.
        the terms class - describe the type of objects,
        the object - describes the instances of classes.
object : An object is an entity which has behaviour and state.
         object is the instatnce of that class.
         eg: Employee class and "employeeOne" is a perticular instatnce of that class.
         Everything is a class and , a perticular instatnce of everything is an object.

Abstract :
  - represent important features without including background details of implementation. Process of hiding implementation and showing only functionality.
      eg. sending message
          user uses the process of sending message but have no idea how it works.
  - can achieve abstarct using : abstract class and interface.
  
Encapsulation :
  - technique of hiding the properites and behaviour of an object into a unit(class) and allowing outside access using access modifier.
  - prevents outside object from directly accessing and modifiying the properties and behaviour of encapsulated object.
  
 Diffrence between Abstraction and Encapsulation :
 
 - Abstraction focuses on outside view of the object (interface).
   Encapsulation prevents client from seeing its inside view where its behaviour is implemented.
   
 - Abstraction solves the problem in design side 
   Encapsulation solves the problem in implementation.
   
 Inheritance :
  - process by which object of one class acquires the properties of other class.
  - Importance
      Improves code resuability
      Implement Polymorphism
      
 Polymorphism :
  - One interface and many implementation
  - Its a charactristic of assigning different meaning or uses to something in diffrent context.
  - achieved using Inheritance, Overloading, Overriding.
  
  Method overriding : process of redefining behaviour of perticular type.
