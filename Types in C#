1. There is no separate heap allocation or garbage collection overhead for value-type variables.

2. When the object is created, the memory is allocated on the managed heap, and the variable holds only a reference to the location of the object. Types on the managed heap require overhead both when they are allocated and when they are reclaimed by the automatic memory management functionality of the CLR, which is known as garbage collection.
