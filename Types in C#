1. There is no separate heap allocation or garbage collection overhead for value-type variables.

2. When the object is created, the memory is allocated on the managed heap, and the variable holds only a reference to the location 
   of the object. Types on the managed heap require overhead both when they are allocated and when they are reclaimed by the automatic 
   memory management functionality of the CLR, which is known as garbage collection. 

3. Constant : when the compiler encounters a constant identifier in C# source code (for example, months), it substitutes the literal value
              directly into the intermediate language (IL) code that it produces. Because there is no variable address associated with a 
              constant at run time, const fields cannot be passed by reference and cannot appear as an l-value in an expression.
            : Use caution when you refer to constant values defined in other code such as DLLs. If a new version of the DLL defines a new 
              value for the constant, your program will still hold the old literal value until it is recompiled against the new version.
            : Constants can be marked as public, private, protected, internal, protected internal or private protected.
            
4. Constant and readonly:
                        The readonly keyword is different from the const keyword. A const field can only be initialized at the declaration
                        of the field. A readonly field can be assigned multiple times in the field declaration and in any constructor. 
                        Therefore, readonly fields can have different values depending on the constructor used. Also, while a const field 
                        is a compile-time constant, the readonly field can be used for runtime constants .
